1. Add type annotations to every parameter and return value of every public function (a name not starting with `_`).
2. Add `tests/test_regressions.py` with one test function per bug fixed, at least 3 tests, and ensure the file passes.
3. Record every fix in `CHANGELOG.md` under `## Unreleased`, using bullets in the form `- fix(<function name>): <short description>`; include at least 3 bullets.
4. Run tests from the project root or package root that provides the intended import path; investigate collection errors before treating tests as passing.
5. Self-check: verify annotations, regression-test coverage, changelog entries, and test results.
